PostgreSQL Mini Project – Customer & Order Management System
=============================================================

Overview:
---------
This project demonstrates a simple customer-order-product relational database design using PostgreSQL. 
It includes:

- 5 related tables
- Sample data insertions
- 20+ practical SQL queries
- A business-oriented scenario to simulate real-world use

Project Scenario:
-----------------
Imagine you're running a small e-commerce business. This database helps you answer questions like:

1. Which customers are generating the most revenue?
2. What are the most and least popular products?
3. Which products are in low stock?
4. What’s the total order value per customer?
5. How can you filter products by price or category?

These kinds of queries are essential for data-driven decision-making.
